# Qiskit Fall Fest 2023

## Welcome
This is the Qiskit Fall Fest event for Purdue University Fort Wayne. We're so excited to have you all here. This event is being hosted by **Purdue University QUantum and AI Center (QUAIC)** sponsored by **IBM** and **PFW Department of Computer Science**. 

We are one of 29 campuses around the world and the only one in Indiana to host the IBM-sponsored [Qiskit Fall Fest Events](https://qiskit.org/events/fall-fest/).

The [Qiskit Fall Fest] is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses worldwide. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their events, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest here includes a series of workshops starting Oct 23 and ends with a hackathon, October 30 - 31. Details are coming.
